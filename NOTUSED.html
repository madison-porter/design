                  I discovered Salt of the Earth Skin (Lindsey) through the power of social media as I was searching for a holistic esthetician in my new home, North Idaho. I immediately resonated with her natural approach to skin care and was impressed by her extensive knowledge of skin science.  Taking the name to heart, Lindsey’s business is all about good quality, natural products, honesty about the skin care industry, and reasonable pricing. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                  Design Process
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Lindsey already had a website up and running, but asked me to review it from a usability perspective to ensure her clients had an enjoyable experience in using her website. I began by combing through each page of Salt of the Earth Skin’s website in detail, identifying any usability pain points through a combination of heuristic evaluation and thorough usability review. From there, I shared my findings and design recommendations with Lindsey. My intention was to gain her approval on any and all changes I suggested before implementation. My recommendations stayed true to Salt of the Earth Skin’s existing branding with a clean and minimal style. After discussing the redesign with Lindsey, I implemented the agreed upon changes in Squarespace. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to updating existing webpages, Lindsey asked me to design a new webpage for her site called “Skin 101”. Her goal was to add educational information to her website that her clients could easily access, such as how to care for their skin type and healthy habits to support their skin health. As the content for this page could easily be text heavy, I had to think of a creative way to make it visually interesting while still ensuring clients received the valuable information. I chose to use an accordion for skin type information so users could personalize the experience and decide which type they’d like to learn more about. As a bonus, this allowed me to break up a text heavy page using a different background color and interactive component. The design was created and developed in Squarespace.  
                </p>
                <p class="end">
                  Lindsey also expressed interest in creating a “Bespoke Skin Health Regimen” document she could provide to clients after their services. This guide would serve as a resource to empower clients to maintain the results of their appointments by outlining the skincare routines, product recommendations, and tips provided by their trusted skin health professional. Not only did I make sure this document looked great and consistent with Lindsey’s style, I also went the extra mile to ensure this document functioned beautifully in a digital environment. She can easily fill it out electronically and email to her clients, making post-appointment communication that much easier.
